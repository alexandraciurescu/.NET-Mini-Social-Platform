# **Mini Social Platform** - *Connext*


Connext is a platform that promotes real-time interaction through a dynamic social environment. This platform provides users with the ability to create public or private profiles, connect with other users,share content and leave comments. Connext offers a simplified experience focused on social interaction, facilitating connections and communication among its members. To achieve this goal, our team has adopted an agile approach, focusing on the Scrum methodology. The project was structured into weekly sprints, where priorities and requirements were established at the beginning of each sprint, ensuring flexibility in case of changes.

The planning of each implementation stage was carried out using the Trello application, through which, at the beginning of each sprint, we discussed and prioritized the next steps to be taken, evenly distributing tasks so that each team member could handle both the backend and frontend parts and go through the same chapters within the Web Application Development subject matter.

Within it, we created 3 specific cards: "To Do", "Doing", and "Done", to keep track of the status of each task and also to highlight the status of the entire application.

Furthermore, for even more efficient collaboration, our solution was to create a project repository on Github to which we both had access, to be able to update the source code in real-time with the changes made by each of us.
